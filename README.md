# AI_From_First_Principles
Repository containing various code that implements and re-creates various Foundational AI components with a focus on re-implementing/implementing them from First Principles. 
This goal of the repo is to both serve as a learning experience on how these components were created but will also focus on converting these modules into well defined production ready classes as a way of improving code style.
